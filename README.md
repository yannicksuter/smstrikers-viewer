# Super Mario Strikers - Asset Viewer

A cross-platform model and content viewer for Super Mario Strikers (Nintendo GameCube, 2005).

## Important Legal Disclaimer

**This project does NOT contain any assets from the original game.**

To use this viewer, you **MUST** own a legitimate copy of Super Mario Strikers and extract the assets yourself. This project is strictly for educational and archival purposes, utilizing knowledge gained from the [smstrikers-decomp](https://github.com/yannicksuter/smstrikers-decomp) project.

**No game files, textures, models, or any copyrighted content from Super Mario Strikers will ever be included in this repository.**

## About

This project is a companion tool to the Super Mario Strikers decompilation project. It uses the knowledge gained during the decompilation process to read and interpret game assets for viewing and analysis purposes.

### Viewer Progress
- Most `.glt` texture bundles load and display textures
- Some bundles/textures are still broken and need investigation
- `.glg` model bundle support is not implemented yet

### Planned Features
- Model viewing (initial focus)
- Animation playback
- Script analysis
- Asset inspection tools

### Not in Scope
- This is **NOT** a recompilation project
- This is **NOT** a port to other platforms
- This is **NOT** a game engine

## Technical Stack

# Initialize submodules (if any)
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Create build directory
mkdir build && cd build

# Configure with CMake (using Ninja generator)
cmake -G Ninja ..

# Build
ninja

# Or use CMake's generic build command
cmake --build .
```

### Platform-Specific Notes

#### macOS
```bash
# Install dependencies via Homebrew
brew install cmake ninja
```

#### Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)
```bash
# Install dependencies
sudo apt-get install cmake ninja-build build-essential libgl1-mesa-dev
```

#### Windows

- Install CMake from https://cmake.org
- Optionally install Ninja from https://ninja-build.org

## Usage

### Running the Viewer

```bash
# From the project root directory
./build/bin/smstrikers-viewer

# Or with command-line options
./build/bin/smstrikers-viewer --no_gui          # Headless mode (for testing)
./build/bin/smstrikers-viewer --object Mario    # Preselect an object
```

### Setting Up Assets

1. **Extract game assets** from your legitimate copy of Super Mario Strikers:
   - Use Dolphin Emulator's filesystem browser (Right-click game → Properties → Filesystem)
   - Export files to your configured asset root (default: `game_assets/`)

2. **Organize files** following the recommended structure:
   ```
   game_assets/
   ├── models/
   │   ├── characters/
   │   └── environments/
   └── textures/
   ```

3. **Launch the viewer** and browse your assets!

### Controls

- **Right Mouse Button**: Rotate camera around object
- **Middle Mouse Button**: Pan camera
- **Mouse Wheel**: Zoom in/out
- **Home Key**: Reset camera to default position
- **ESC**: Exit application

### Configuration

Settings are saved automatically to `~/.smstrikers-viewer.conf`. Access them via:
- **Menu**: View → Settings

Available settings:
- Camera controls (pan inversion)
- Default render mode (Wireframe/Opaque/Shaded)
- UI visibility (gizmo, camera info, controls)
- Asset root path (filesystem-based tree)

## Current Features

Asset browser backed by filesystem scan  
Orbital camera controls  
Multiple render modes (Wireframe, Opaque, Shaded)  
Configurable UI and controls  
Command-line options  
`.glt` texture bundle loading with texture preview (most files)  

Some `.glt` bundles/textures are still broken and need investigation  
`.glg` model bundle loading  
Animation playback
