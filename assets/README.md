## ⚠️ IMPORTANT

**NEVER place original Super Mario Strikers game assets in this repository!**

This directory may contain:
- Example test files
- Documentation images
- Reference materials

## User Assets

Users should extract game assets to a separate location outside this repository.

Example structure for user's local setup:

The viewer will be configured to load assets from user-specified paths.

## README for Assets

Create a `README_ASSETS.md` in your local asset directory explaining:
- How you extracted the assets

- Directory structure

This information should NOT be committed to this repository if it contains
copyrighted material or detailed information about the game's internal structure
